# PaymentGuard-AI
ML system predicts SaaS payment defaults 30 days early using payment/usage data. 87% accuracy (AUC 0.89) on 7k+ customers, flags $142k/mo at-risk revenue. Targets key risks: e-checks, short-term contracts. Cuts losses 38% via alerts/offers.

# Predictive Subscription Payment Default Risk Analysis
Machine Learning Solution for SaaS Revenue Protection

## Business Problem
Identify customers at risk of subscription payment default 30 days in advance to:

Reduce revenue leakage (avg. 5-15% MRR loss in SaaS)

Decrease customer churn from payment failures (42% of involuntary churn)

Improve cash flow predictability

3 Outlier handling: Removed 2.1% of extreme MonthlyCharges

## Model Development

. Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Classifier

. Key Parameters:
n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=5

. Feature Importance:

   1.Contract Type (34%)

   2 Payment Method (28%)

   3 Monthly Charges (22%)

## Business Impact Analysis
